# Apriori
Final Project for Data Structures Class

This is an implementation of the apriori data mining algorithm written in C++. This pulls transaction data from a file and determines if there are any assocaitions to be made and if those assocations meet the minimum support then returns the associations that passed and their respective support. All data structures and algorithms were built by hand to accomodate the requirements of the assignment
